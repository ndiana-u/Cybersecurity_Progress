LAB NAME: DOM XSS in jQuery anchor href attribute sink using location.search source

DESCRIPTION
This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the submit feedback page. It uses the jQuery library's $ selector
 function to find an anchor element, and changes its href attribute using data from location.search.
To solve this lab, make the "back" link alert document.cookie.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Apprentice.

STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
-opened lab in browser
- I right clicked on the page , clicked on "Inspect' to check the elements.
-I found that if i change the return path in the url to something else it would reflect in the href attribute of the 'a' tag of the back link.
- I changed the return path to: returnPath=javascript:alert(document.cookie)
- Then submitted a random feedback and clicked 'back'
- An alert box popped up.
