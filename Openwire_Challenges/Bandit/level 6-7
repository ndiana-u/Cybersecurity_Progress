Lots of error messages will show and can be filtered out using: 2> /dev/null
the command becomes:  find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> /dev/null
after finding the file,i viewed its content using cat 
: cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

/ : Search the entire server (/ is the root directory on Linux similar to the C:/ Drive on Windows)
