STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
- I ran the lab in burp browser so I could intercept the request with Burp proxy.
- Navigated to the comment section in the lab.
- I searched for a random word 'food' in the comment section.
- I intercepted the request.
- Changed the COMMENT input to '<SCRIPT>alert('xss!')</SCRIPT>'
-An alert box popped up in the lab's webpage showing the alert message.
