DESCRIPTION
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 
32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is 
only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.

COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED:
ssh, telnet, nc, ncat, socat, openssl, s_client, nmap, netstat, ss

STEPS
1. Scan for open ports with command: nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
There are 5 open ports 31046, 31518, 31691, 31790, 31960. 
2. ncat --ssl localhost <port> . Try each open port number and input the pasword. The correct port will give you the rsa private key while the rest just echoes the same password back.
3. highlight the RSA key from the 'Begin RSA PRIVATE KEY' till the 'END RSA PRIVATE KEY' line. Rightclick and copy it.
4. mkdir /tmp/privatekey_folder - to create a new temporary folder to store key in.
5. cd /tmp/privatekey_folder -change to this directory
6. nano sshkey.private - to create and open a text file using nano text editor
7. Rightclick and 'paste' to paste the RSA PRIVATE KEY in the file.
8. ctrl + X. Then yes - to save file.
9. ls -l sshkey.private - to check permission of text file.
10. chmod 700 sshkey.private - to change permissions
- “700” means:
The owner of the file has read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions, which add up to 7.
The group and others have no permissions (0).
11. ssh -i sshkey.private bandit17@localhost -p 2220 - use the key as a pass for bandit17 level
12. cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17 - to get the password for level 17
