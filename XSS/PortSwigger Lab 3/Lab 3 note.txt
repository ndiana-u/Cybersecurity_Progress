LAB NAME:  DOM XSS IN DOUMENT.WRITE SINK USING SOURCE LOCATION.SEARCH

DESCRIPTION
 This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. It uses the JavaScript document.write
function, which writes data out to the page. The document.write function is called with data from location.search, which you can control using
the website URL.
 To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Apprentice

STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
- I inputted a random alphanumeric string 'food123' into the search bar.
- Then right-clicked on the page, clicked on 'inspect'and then on 'elements'. 
- I noticed that my random string 'food123' has been placed inside an img src attribute.
- To break out of the img attribute I searched for: "><svg onload=alert(1)> .
