DESCRIPTION
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"

STEPS TO SOLVE IT
- I had to work with curl today. curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server.
- There was no hint in the inspect tab.
- This level required that I access this page from natas5 wedsite link and not natas4. This means that I have to change the HTTP header on its 
way to the server, hence the use of curl.
- The curl syntax: curl <url to get data from> -u <user> -e <referrer URL>
- I ran this command in bash: curl http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/ -u natas4 -e http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
- It outputted the command in the terminal.
