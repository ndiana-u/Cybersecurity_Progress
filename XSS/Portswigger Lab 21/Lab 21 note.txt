DESCRIPTION
This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. The reflection occurs inside a template string with angle brackets, single, and double quotes HTML encoded, and backticks escaped. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function inside the template string.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: PRACTITIONER.

STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
I searched for ${alert(document.domain)}
i did this because the xss context was into a Javascript template literal.
