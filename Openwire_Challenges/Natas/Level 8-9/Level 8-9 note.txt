STEPS TO SOLVE IT
- i went through the source code and I realized that the input was being executed without any form of sanitization.
- this means that I could do command injection.
- When I added a semicolon before running a command it would break out of grep in the passthru function and execute whatever is after the 
semi-colon.
- I ran ; ls-la; first and all the directories and files contained in natas 9 showed.
- I ran this command and got the password:  ; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10;

SKILL I USED
Command Injection


EXPLANATION OF SOURCE CODE
1. Initialization:
$key = "";
* The variable $key is initialized as an empty string. It will later hold the user-provided input.

2. Checking for Input:
if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}
* The array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST) checks if the parameter needle exists in the $_REQUEST array, which combines $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE data.
If the needle parameter exists, its value is assigned to $key.

3.  Executing a Command:
if($key != "") {
    passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
}
* If $key is not empty (meaning the user provided some input via needle), the code uses the passthru() function to execute a shell command.
The command being executed is grep -i $key dictionary.txt, where:
grep -i: Searches the file dictionary.txt for lines that match $key, ignoring case (because of the -i flag).
$key: The userâ€™s input is inserted into the shell command.
dictionary.txt: The file being searched for occurrences of $key
