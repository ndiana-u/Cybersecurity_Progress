DESCRIPTION
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

COMMANDS NEEDED MAYBE:


STEPS
- create a temporary directory using "mktemp --d"
- change directrory to that temp directroty using cd command: cd /tmp/tmp.ROOoXAjUur
- copy the data.txt file into the directory using cp: "cp ~/data.txt ."
- change the name of the file since it isnt a text file to another name using mv command: mv data.txt data
- use xxd to convert the data into its binary equivalent: xxd -r data > binary
- use file command to see what type of data is stored:
file binary
- We can see that the file was compressed using qzip so we can decompress the data using the gunzip command. When trying to decompress an gzip file it is important that the file has the correct extension.
 so we first change the extension to gz using:
 mv binary binary.gz then gunzip binary.gz
 - ls to see the files in directory
 - file binary
- We see that the data is compressed using bzip2. For decompressing an bzip2 file we can use the bunzip2 command: bunzip2 binary.
- ls
-file binary.out
- We see that its once more gzip compressed file we use the same procedure to decompress the file
-ls
- file binary
- We see that the data is saved in an tar archive. For extracting an tar file we use the tar command:
tar -xf binary
- t looks like the password file has recursively been compressed using “tar”, “gzip” and “bzip2”. We keep repeating the above steps tell we get the password file.
