DESCRIPTION
There is nothing on this page.

STEPS TO SOLVE IT
- There was no information link but a hint was embedded in the inspect tab. 
- The comment said that 'not even google could find it'. It was talking about the robots.txt page, which Google uses to tell search engine
crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on the site. It is used to identify restricted or private areas of a site.
- I navigated to this link- http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt. A directory called /s3cr3t/ access was disallowed.
- I accessed the directory via http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/
- A user.txt file was there which contained natas4 password.
