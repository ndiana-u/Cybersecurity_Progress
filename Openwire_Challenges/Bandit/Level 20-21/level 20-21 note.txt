DESCRIPTION
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a 
commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). 
If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).
NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED:
ssh, nc, cat, bash, screen, tmux, Unix ‘job control’ (bg, fg, jobs, &, CTRL-Z, …)

STEPS
A
1. Open a new terminal, connect using SSH to level 20,then: 
2. nc -lvp 12334 -s 127.0.0.1 :to set up a server.
Your server is listening for incoming connections on port 12334.

B
In another terminal window (while your network daemon is running), after running SSH:
1. ls -l : to find the setuid binary file and its name. This lists the files/folders there.
2. ./suconnect 12334: to execute the setuid binary with the port number as an argument.
A connection has been established between setuid binary and the server.

C
In the first terminal,
-type the level 20 password and send.
-The level 21 password would be sent back by the client(setuid binary).

*You'll notice that in the client terminal, a message popped up verifying that the password sent by the server matches.

NETWORK DAEMON
A network daemon is a background service that listens on a port for incoming connections. The challenge is pushing you to think about the 
interaction between a client (the setuid binary) and the server (your listener, such as netcat).
By running your own listener (a simple "network daemon"), you can observe the behavior of the setuid binary as it connects to the specified 
port and transmits/receives data.


COMMAND MEANING  nc -lvp 12334 -s 127.0.0.1 
nc: to set up network daemon and a simple server. 
-l: tells nc to listen for an incoming connection.
-v: enables verbose output.
-p: specifies the port number to listen on.
12334: a random non-privileged port number (above 1024) to avoid needing root permissions.
-s 127.0.0.1: makes sure it listens only on localhost (127.0.0.1), which ensures only local connections are allowed.
