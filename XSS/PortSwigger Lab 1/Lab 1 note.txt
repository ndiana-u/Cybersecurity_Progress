STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
- I ran the lab in burp browser so I could intercept the request with Burp proxy.
- I searched for a random word 'food' in the search bar.
- I intercepted the request.
- Changed the SEARCH input to '<SCRIPT>alert('youve-been-xss!')</SCRIPT>'
-An alert box popped up in the lab's webpage showing the alert message.
