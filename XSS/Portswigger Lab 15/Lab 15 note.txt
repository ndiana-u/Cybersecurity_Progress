LAB LINK: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-href-attribute-double-quotes-html-encoded

STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
I posted a comment and i noticed the username was clickable.
once i clicked on it, I was redirected to the website link I filled with that comment.
- I inspected the code of the webpage by rightclicking on it and then on 'inspect'.
- I noticed that the website link was put in href attribute and enclosed with double quotes.
I posted a new comment with this payload in the website section: javascript:alert(document.domain). Once i was doen I clicked on the username and it was executed.
