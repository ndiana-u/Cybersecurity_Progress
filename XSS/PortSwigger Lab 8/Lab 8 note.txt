LAB NAME: DOM XSS in AngularJS expression with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded

DESCRIPTION
This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in a AngularJS expression within the search functionality.
AngularJS is a popular JavaScript library, which scans the contents of HTML nodes containing the ng-app attribute (also known as an
AngularJS directive). When a directive is added to the HTML code, you can execute JavaScript expressions within double curly braces. This 
technique is useful when angle brackets are being encoded.
To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that executes an AngularJS expression and calls the alert function.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Practitioner.

STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
- Searched for a random string 'blah' in the search box of the lab.
- right-clicked and went to 'inspect' to see how the string is handled.
- I noticed it was handled by ng-app directive.
- Inputted the payload containing an angular JS expression in the search box: {{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}
