# DESCRIPTION
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable

# COMMANDS YOU MIGHT NEED: 
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

# STEPS
ls = to list the files or directories.
cd inhere = change directory to inhere
du -b -a = to list the byte size of all the files in the directory 
find -size 1033c = to get the file with size 1033
cat /.maybehere07/.file2 = To view the content of file2.

# STRUGGLES
I tried du -h to get the sizes in readable form but they were all kilobytes
I tried du -b to get the sizes in bytes. They were really large.
When i tried du -b -a. It listed each file and their sizes. I noticed the 'maybehere' were directories that contained other files and the '-a' command listed the size of each of them. I just checked for a file which size was 1033 bytes.
