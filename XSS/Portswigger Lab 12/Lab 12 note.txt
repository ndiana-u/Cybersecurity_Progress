LAB NAME: Reflected XSS into HTML context with all tags blocked except custom ones

DESCRIPTION
This lab blocks all HTML tags except custom ones.
To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects a custom tag and automatically alerts document.cookie.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Practitioner.

LAB LINK: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-html-context-with-all-standard-tags-blocked

STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
- Checked the portswigger xss cheatsheet for custom tags
https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet

- I picked the onfocus event handler which doesnt require a user interaction
<xss onfocus=alert(document.cookie) autofocus tabindex=1>

- I searched for it in the search bar and an alert box popped up.
- I knew I just had to inject it into the page using the exploit server.
- I url encoded it and it became: %3Cxss%20onfocus%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29%20autofocus%20tabindex%3D1%3E
- I put it in the body of the exploit server in a script tag.
- I tried it without an id and it didn't work so I added and ID x and a hash to automatically focus on this element x.
