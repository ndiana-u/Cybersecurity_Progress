DESCRIPTION
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable

STEPS
ls
cd inhere
to list the byte size of all the files in the directory 'du -b -a'
tried du -h to get the sizes in readable form but they were all kilobytes
tried du -b to get the sizes in bytes. They were really large.
when i tried du -b -a. It listed each file and their sizes. I noticed the 'maybehere' were directories that contained other files and the '-a' command listed the size of each of them. I just checked for a file which size was 1033 bytes.
