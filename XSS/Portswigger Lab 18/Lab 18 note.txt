LAB NAME: Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets HTML encoded

DESCRIPTION
This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality where angle brackets are encoded. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the alert function.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Apprentice.
