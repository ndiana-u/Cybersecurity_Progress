GIT BRANCH 
A Git branch is like a separate line of development in your project. It allows you to work on different features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
Key Points About Git Branches:
- Separate Workspaces: Each branch has its own set of changes, so you can work on multiple things at once without interfering with each other.
- Main Branch: Usually, thereâ€™s a main branch (commonly called master or main) where stable code lives. You can create other branches for new features or fixes.
