DESCRIPTION
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

COMMANDS NEEDED MAYBE:
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

STEPS
command: grep -a === data.txt | strings
when i used just grep i was told that was a binary file
when i used: grep -a = data.txt , i got a lot of lines of texts that weew both strings and none strings.
so i made the = sign 3 so that would remove the lines with single = sign and added the ' | strings' so only lines with strings would show.
