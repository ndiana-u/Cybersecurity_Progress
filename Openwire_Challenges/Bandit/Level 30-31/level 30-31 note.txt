GIT TAG 
In Git, a tag is a reference that points to a specific commit, often used to mark important points in the repository’s history, such as 
releases (e.g., version 1.0, v2.5). Tags are similar to branches, but unlike branches, they don’t move once created — they are fixed 
references to a commit.
