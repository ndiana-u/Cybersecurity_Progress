DESCRIPTION
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 
4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time.

STEPS
1. nc localhost 30002 - to connect to the daemon and to see how it accepts input.
It required the password and secret pincode on a single line seperated by a space.
2. mktemp -d : to create a temporary directory.
3. cd /tmp/'temporary directory' : change to the temporary directory.
4. chmod 700 -R /tmp/'temporary directory' : to change permission fo the directory to have read, write and execute privileges for the owner.
4. nano bruteforce.sh : to create the bruteforce shell script.
Inside the text file, write or paste your script and save.
5. chmod +x bruteforce.sh : to add execute privilege to the bruteforce script.
6. ./bruteforce.sh : to execute the shells script.
