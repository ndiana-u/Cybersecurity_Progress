LAB NAME: DOM XSS in jQuery selector sink using a hashchange event

DESCRIPTION
This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability on the home page. It uses jQuery's $() selector function to auto-scroll 
to a given post, whose title is passed via the location.hash property.
To solve the lab, deliver an exploit to the victim that calls the print() function in their browser.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Apprentice.

STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
- Opened lab in browser
- I right clicked on the page , clicked on "Inspect' to check the elements.
- I scrolled down to the script element to check it content.
- The jQuery script listens for changes to the URL hash and scrolls the page to a specific blog post based on the hash value.
- I went to the exploit server provided on the lab home page.
- I added the payload below to the body of the Exploit server page.
payload: <iframe src="https://0ae700950361f1e283767eca00eb009d.web-security-academy.net//#" onload="this.src+='<img src=x onerror=print()>'"></iframe>
- I stored it and clicked on 'deliver to victim'. Once the victim visits the exploit page, it would trigger the iframe to load the target site.

PAYLOAD EXPLANATION
1. The iframe is an HTML element used to embed another document within the current page.
2. The code attempts to append an image element with an invalid source to the src attribute. On error, the print() function is called.
