LOGIN
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220


DESCRIPTION
The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED:
ssh, ls, cat

STEPS
login with: ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat ~/readme"
When you run this command, SSH will log into the server, immediately execute cat ~/readme, and output the contents of the readme 
file to your terminal. Since the .bashrc issue causes a logout upon login, this method bypasses the interactive shell entirely
