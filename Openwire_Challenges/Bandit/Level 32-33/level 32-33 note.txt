ssh bandit32@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220


DESCRIPTION
After all this git stuff, itâ€™s time for another escape. Good luck!

COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED
sh, man

STEPS
1. ls : I noticed that the command was changed to uppercase
2. $0 :  spawns a new shell. I need to get out of the uppercase shell and to a normal one. 
3. echo $0: to get the name of the currently used shell. It is sh.
4. ls -la : to list all files or directories.
See that the SUID bit is set for the uppershell (The SUID bit allows a file to be executed with the same privileges as the owner of the file) 
and the binary is owned by bandit33.
5. whoami : to check the user's identity and it is bandit33.
6. id: just to confirm the identity of the user. 
7. cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33 : to get the password for bandit33.
