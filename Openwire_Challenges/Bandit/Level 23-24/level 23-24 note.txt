DESCRIPTION
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration 
and see what command is being executed.
NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you
beat this level!
NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…

COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED:
chmod, cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)

STEPS
1. cd /etc/cron.d
2. ls -l : to list all files/directories
3. cat cronjob_bandit23
4. cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh: to see the content of the script.
5. cd ~ : Change directory back to home directory.
6. mktemp -d :to create a temporary directory
7. touch password :create a new file called password where the password would be stored.
8. nano myfirstscript.sh
9. Type these in the script file
 #!/bin/bash
 cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp.7XDAdkIYh5/password
10. Save file and exit text editor.
11. chmod 777 -R /tmp/tmp.7XDAdkIYh5: change permission to give any user read,write and execute privilege to the folder and any file/folder 
under it.
12. cp myfirstscript.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo : copy the script file to the location where the cron job scheduler script will execute it.
