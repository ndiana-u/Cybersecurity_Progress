LOGIN DETAILS
Username: natas7
password: bmg8SvU1LizuWjx3y7xkNERkHxGre0GS
URL:      http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org

STEPS TO SOLVE IT
- The hint given was <!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->
- Two pages that could be accessed from the webpage directly were the home and about pages.
- I needed a way to navigate to /etc/natas_webpass/natas directly.
- I tried http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/etc/natas_webpass/natas and it didnt work.
- This is the url for the home page- http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home 
- This is where path traversal came in. I had to set the page variable to the relative path of our password file and that's when it worked. 
- This is the link to access the password file- http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas8
