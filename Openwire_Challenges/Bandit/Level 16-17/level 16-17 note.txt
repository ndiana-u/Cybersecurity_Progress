DESCRIPTION
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.

COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED:
ssh, telnet, nc, ncat, socat, openssl, s_client, nmap, netstat, ss

STEPS
1. Scan for open ports with command: nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
2. Check if each open port uses ssl/tls with command: openssl s_client -connect localhost:port
There are 5 open ports 31046, *n31518, 31691, 31790, 31960. Try each port number
