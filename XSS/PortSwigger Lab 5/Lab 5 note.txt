LAB NAME: DOM XSS IN innerHTML SINK USING SOURCE location.search

DESCRIPTION
This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. It uses an innerHTML assignment,
which changes the HTML contents of a div element, using data from location.search.
To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Apprentice.

STEPS I USED TO SOLVE THIS LAB
- Opened the lab in my chrome browser.
- Searched for a random word 'food'
- I saw that my 'food' showed in a span tag.
- I searched for this payload in the search bar to break out of the span tag: "><img src = 1 onerror=alert(1)>
