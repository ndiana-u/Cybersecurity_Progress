DESCRIPTION
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration 
and see what command is being executed.
NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. 
If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED:
cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)

STEPS
1. cd /etc/cron.d
2. ls -l : to list all files/directories
3. cat cronjob_bandit23
4. cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh: to see the content of the script.
5.  echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d '' -f 1 : this is the line that 'mytarget' runs to get the name of the temporary file.
I replaced the '$myname' in the command to bandit23 which is the level password, I'm looking for.
6.  cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349 : to get the content of the file which is the password for level 23.

COMMAND EXPLANATION(echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d '' -f 1)
1. `echo I am user bandit23`
This command outputs the string `I am user bandit23` to the standard output (terminal).
2. `| md5sum`
The `md5sum` command calculates the MD5 hash of the input text. In this case, it takes the string `"I am user bandit23"` and converts it into
a unique 32-character hexadecimal hash. MD5 is a cryptographic hash function used for creating checksums.
3. `| cut -d ' ' -f 1`
The `cut` command is used to split the output into fields based on a delimiter. The `-d ' '` part tells `cut` to use a space as the delimiter,
and `-f 1` specifies that only the first field (which is the hash in this case) should be printed.
